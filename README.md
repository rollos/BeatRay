# BeatRay

BeatRay will allow A DJ to build customized lightshows that sync with the DJ Program of their choice.


Taking inspiration from MusicBeam.org, the lighshows will be displayed on a projector, which simulates an array of lights that you would see at a professional concerts.
The difference between BeatRay and MusicBeam, is that this program will provide users with an Interface to create these lightshows, and sync it with the music that they've created.

This program is still in early development.
