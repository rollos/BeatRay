# BeatRay

BeatRay will allow A DJ to build customized lightshows that sync with the DJ Program of their choice.


Taking inspiration from MusicBeam.org, the lighshows will be displayed on a projector, which simulates an array of lights that you would see at a professional concerts.
The difference between BeatRay and MusicBeam, is that this program will provide users with an Interface to create these lightshows, and sync it with the music that they've created.

Beatray uses the MIDI clock from programs such as Traktor to sync the lightshow with the song that is playing. Your custom designed lightshow can be synced with anything that outputs a Midi Clock, even hardware synthesizers.

Beatray has a live performance portion, which gives you full control over the structure of your lightshow, allowing you to improvise on the spot.
